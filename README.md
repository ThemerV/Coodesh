## README

## What is this repository for?

1. This repository contains code for completing a test, consisting of 5 Java tasks, 3 SQL queries, and a dashboard analysis.

### Before you start

- The project must use Java for the programming tasks and SQL for the queries.
- Document the entire investigation process for the development of the activity (README.md in your repository); the results of these tasks are as important as your thought process and decisions as you complete them, so try to document and present your hypotheses and decisions as much as possible.
